Bellabeat case study
# Summary
Using the 6 phases of data analytics , I was able to identify health trends and patterns amongst smart device users. The findings helped create marketing recommendations for Bellabeat's leaf tracker.
# Solution
The results helped identify common health and fitness trends amongst smart device users.  Using these trends, I was able to create marketing recommendations for Bellabeat's latest smart device - leaf fitness tracker. These recommendations include:  Identifying the target audience; leaf's application as an accessory; provide and create fitness goals using our summary findings; when to advertise to current and potential customers; and implementing a community where users can share fitness goals.
# Approach
I used a public data set from Kaggle and merged it with another data set from Google Scholar. I reviewed the source and characteristics  of our dataset to ensure reliability, accuracy, and to limit bias in our final results.  Excel and SQL were used in data cleaning and analysis, while Tableau helped visualize my findings. During the analysis stage, I aggregated my data to reflect averages over time. This approach helps identify trends  by factoring changes factoring time.
